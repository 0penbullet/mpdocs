# Order Labels

## Overview

[Mageplaza Order Labels extension](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-order-labels/) provides a feature that allows the admin to customize the creation of columns containing labels to mark, sort orders in Order Grid explicitly, thereby easier to manage orders. With this module, admin can not only use an image or a piece of text to display the label but can also use a combination of both to display the label that you want to create. In addition, this module also allows manual assignment or automatic labeling of orders. Moreover, this module also displays and allows for Label editing in both Order Grid and Order Form. In particular, it also improves the Order Status display section and allows it to be displayed at Frontend so that customers can easily know how their order is in status.
