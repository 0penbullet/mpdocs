# Edit Order

## Overview

Currently, Magento only allows editing **Customer Information** and **Address Information** at the view order page. If you want to edit other information, you must go to the separated **Edit Order** page, then the old order will automatically be canceled and the new order will be created. Also, admin can only edit other information (besides Customer and Address Information) when Order is Pending.

With [Mageplaza Edit Order](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-edit-order/), the editing becomes easier than ever. This extension allows admin to edit information right at the order view page via slide popup without having to switch to another link. Moreover, Quick Edit action is integrated to be able to edit all order information at the same time. In addition, it automatically calculates the shipping fee if the order information changes.
