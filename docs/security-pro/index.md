# Security 

## Overview 
Security issues for Magento have left a big question mark in the community of online stores. This problem is specially cared when Magento-based stores which own critical information and huge transactional volume can easily become ideal prey for blackhat hackers to attack. To help online stores prevent brutal break-ins, Mageplaza has developed the Security extension. [Magento 2 Security extension](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-security/) gives store owners the ability to detect the IP addresses that are intentionally attacking their store at any given time. Therefore, they have timely measures to prevent this issue such as blocking those IP addresses or sending warning emails to store owners.

Security Professional grants store owners the ability to forbid all login attempts at a period of time, which is called Away Mode. Furthermore, they can keep track and spot out all changed files, activities of other admin users as well as back up logs for the record purpose.  

## How to use
You can review login records from the dashboard when entering the backend. The log displays the newest 5 logins and you can click on the login name to view the details.

  * You can also block IP addresses as wildcard masks as below:
    * ``10.0.0. *``
    * ``10.0. *. *``
    * ``10.0.0. * - 123.0.0. *``

### Reset Command line

* If store admins mistakenly enter their IP addresses in the Blacklist, this following command lines can be run first: 
```
bin/magento security:reset blacklist 
```
Next, run this command line:
```
bin/magento cache:flush
```
*  After you have finished running those above command lines which reset the **Blacklist(s)** field, you will be able to access the admin page again. Note that the **Blacklist(s)** field is reset now so don’t forget to reenter the blacklist IPs.
* Similarly, the **Whitelist(s)** can be reset using these command lines: 
```
bin/magento security:reset whitelist
bin/magento cache:flush
```
* When admin users want to access backend in the period of Away Mode suddenly, follow two command lines to turn Away Mode off.
```
bin/magento security:reset away mode
bin/magento cache:flush
```

* If you run the command ``bin/magento security:reset``, both **Blacklist(s)**, **Whitelist(s)** and **Away Mode** will be reset.
