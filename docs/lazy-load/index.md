# Lazy Load

## Overview

Normally, all images of a web page are loaded at the same time, which likely slow down the page speed and customers will leave because it takes too much time to wait. Therefore, Mageplaza has released [Lady Load extension](https://mageplaza.com/magento-2-lazy-load/)  which helps reduce bandwidth, page loading time and enhance the website performance by loading images only when necessary. Lady Load can be applied to: Category Page, Product Detail Page, CMS Page, Search Result Page, Related, Up-sell, Cross-sell products and exclude any page or image you want.

In addition, the extension also supports lazy loading by icons or placeholders and setting Loading Threshold for images. And especially, Lazy Load extension is fully compatible with [SEO extension](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-seo-extension/) to automatically insert alt attributes if the image does not already have this attribute. This is an extremely useful feature that Mageplaza has created.
