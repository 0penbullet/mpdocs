# SEO Rules

## Overview

The term Metadata in "Metadata Rules", sometimes, brings a vague definition when it comes to the internet due to the confusing why this time they mention “data” but at another time they use “metadata” word. But long story for short, it’s “Data describes other data” including information to define individual pages on a online website. From there, it also gives the necessary permission for search crawlers acknowledge, understand and evaluate valuable of a page content, define wherever will it be displayed on search page results.

Also, art in information governance is the equally important key that what we need to be well aware soon when being a store owner of thousand business items. In order to define your products have better description, you’re gonna manually add metadata per product, per page, per category all by yourself?
