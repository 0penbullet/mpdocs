# Customer Approval


## Overview

Managing customers from the beginning will help you control your website well, gain profits and obtain certain customer trust. With [Mageplaza's Customer Approval extension](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-customer-approval/), you can definitely do that. Admin will receive an email notification when a customer successfully registers for an account and he can choose auto-approve or manually approve. Accordingly, your customers will receive email notifications of successful signing up for an account, successfully approved or not approved. You should install [Mageplaza_SMTP](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-smtp/) to avoid your email to be sent to the spam box and it is fully compatible with the Customer Approval extension.
