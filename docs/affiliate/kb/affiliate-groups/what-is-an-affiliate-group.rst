What is an Affiliate Group?
===========================


An affiliate group, or tier, gives you the option to create different commission amounts for affiliate payment.

Each affiliate group can have up to 10 levels of commission rates.

Once you create an affiliate group, you can manually assign affiliates to a specific group so that they receive those commissions rates when referring new sales to you.

Alternatively, you can set up performance bonuses that can upgrade an affiliate member's group once they reach a targeted sales or commission amount.
