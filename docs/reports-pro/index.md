# Reports Professional

Previously, Mageplaza has released Reports module that helps shop owners statistically and more easily manage the number of customers, the number of transactions, or the total amount of money your store earned in a day/year/etc. In order to meet the higher demands of the store manager, we have upgraded this module to a new version to help shop owners manage as well as see clearly the growth or declining rate of sectors that need to be managed, such as the number of best-selling products, countries or provinces with the highest number of purchases.

## How to configure

From the Admin Panel, go to ``Store > Settings > Configuration > Mageplaza Extensions > Reports``
