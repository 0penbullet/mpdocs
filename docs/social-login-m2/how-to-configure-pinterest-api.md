# How to configure Pinterest API

**Pinterest** requires you to create an external application that links your website to their API. Pinterest's **API Key** and **Secret APP** are what we call app login credentials. This application will link your website to the Pinterest API and these credentials are needed for Pinterest users to access your site.

The credentials may also differ in format, name and content depending on the social network.
To enable authentication with this provider and to sign up for the new Pinterest API Application, follow these steps:

## Step 1
