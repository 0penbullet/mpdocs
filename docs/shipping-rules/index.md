    - For example: Admins configure `Minimal fee change` is $5. After calculating the shipping fee will be $20. Original shipping fee is $10. The actual shipping fee will be $10 + $5 (if `How to apply fee = Add extra fee`) or $10 - $5 (if `How to apply fee = Subtract extra fee`). It's the same as with `Maximal fee change`
