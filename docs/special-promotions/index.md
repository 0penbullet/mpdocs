- **Apply**: Select **Discount Type** for promotion rules.

- **Percent of product price discount**: Discount by a percentage from the original price. Discount applies to each eligible item in the cart. Example: **Discount Amount** is 10. So if any product meets the conditions, it will get a 10% discount from the original price.

- **Buy X get Y free (discount amount is Y)**: Set the quantity that customers must buy to receive free quantities. For example: **Discount Amount (get Y)** is 1, **Discount Qty Step (Buy X)** is 3.

If you buy Buy 3 tee shirts, you will receive a fourth product for free.

- **For each $X spent, get $Y discount**: Set the amount that customers have to buy with each product to receive a discounted amount. Example: **Discount Amount (get $Y)** is 1, **Discount Qty Step (Buy X)** is 30. So when you have a cart with each **Subtotal** product is $30, you will get a discount of $1.

- **Discount Amount**: Enter the discounted amount in the **Discount Amount** field.

- **Maximum Qty Discount is Applied To**: Enter the maximum number of same products that can be eligible for a discount in the same cart.

-Â **Discount Qty Step (Buy X)**: Enter the amount in the Discount Qty Step (Buy X) field that the customer must purchase to receive the discount.

Discount will apply. If the Subtotal is not reached $ 30, there is no discount for that product.

    - **Maximum Discount Amount**: Enter the maximum amount that can be discounted by **Percent of cart subtotal** to apply the discount for the whole cart. Example: **Maximum Discount Amount** is 10. So the maximum discount amount should not exceed 10% of the whole cart value.
