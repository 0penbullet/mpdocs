  - Set the point or discount that customers can get access to refer link to place order for each order
  - There are 4 actions that admins can choose:
    - `Give fixed points to Customers`: No matter how much Order Total, Customer can get X points
    - Give X points for every Y amount of price: Based on Order Total to calculate the number of points that Customer can receive in a certain proportion.
    - Give a fixed discount to Customer: No matter how much Total Order, Customer can receive a certain amount of discount. Customer will receive discount for whole cart instead of receiving point
    - Give percent discount to Customer: No matter how much Order Total, Customer can receive a percentage discount. Customers will receive the discount for whole cart instead of receiving the point

### IV. Transactions.
The right path is ``Marketing > Reward Points: Transaction``.

#### 4.1. General Management.
This is the place where admins can create and manage transactions. By entering this interface, admins can add/minus customer’s reward point(s).

![](https://i.imgur.com/1iY4qA3.png)

  * **View**: To review a transaction, choose “View” in the **Action** column.
  * **Cancel**: To cancel a created transaction (in case its expiration date hasn’t come yet), select the transaction and choose “Cancel” in the **Action** box (at the left of the grid).
  * **Expired**: Admins need to take this action if a transaction isn’t expired automatically. At this point, take the same action when admins view/cancel a transaction, choose “Expired” then process with the ``OK`` button.
* Admins can filter, hide/display **Column** or export rates.

#### 4.2. Add new transaction.

  * You can leave this field blank.
* In the **Points expire after** field
  * The added point(s) of this transaction will be expired after X day(s) from the time you create this transaction.
  * Admins have the right to add higher point(s) than the maximum point of the amount which a customer can accumulate (*E.x: max point = 1000, admins can add 1100 points or even more to the customer balance*).

#### 4.3. View Transaction.
