# Quick Flush Cache

## Overview

In Magento default, after configuring some actions at backend, it will show a message with flush cache request to apply change or invalid indexer. The admin then needs to open the **Cache Management** page and click on **Flush Magento Cache**, which takes a few minutes to completely flush the cache, similar to the reindex. With [Mageplaza Quick Flush Cache](https://mageplaza.com/quick-flush-cache/) will help admin save time as quickly as possible. The module adds a link right next to the system notification message, when clicked, the ajax flush is the type of cache that is invalid or indexer is invalid.



## How to Configure

From the Admin Panel, go to `Stores > Settings > Configuration > Mageplaza Extensions > Quick Flush Cache`

  - **Yes (Manual)***: Show a message after saving configuration. Instead of clicking **Cache Management** to move to the **Flush Magento Cache**, now you only need to click **Flush Now** link and wait for a few seconds, the cache will be cleared.
