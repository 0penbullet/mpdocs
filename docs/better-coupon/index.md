# Better Coupon

## Overview
Imagine those scenarios: Store owners desire to generate a one-time use coupon per customer, but it takes at least 5 minutes to make a new one manually? Or take another look at this case: the coupon codes generated in Magento 2 isn't matched with the current discount program, either they can't import their pre-made coupon codes into Magento 2 system unfortunately. Consuming time tasks are coming up more, you have no idea how to give the applied coupon checkout link to customers so that they don't need to ask and enter the coupon every time they come to your store?

All disturbing issues now can be remedied by only one proficient plugin. Better Coupon extension, supplied by Mageplaza, is designed to craft many coupons timely and send them over customers via emails just by one click. And the configurations seems cannot be easier if you can follow this documentation carefully.

```

##### 1.2.2. Quick Coupon Link Generator 

![bettercoupon4](https://i.imgur.com/BqWYG96.png)

* At the **Pattern** column:
  * Follow this rule to create a pattern: [4A] - 4 alpha, [4N] - 4 numeric, [4AN] - 4 alphanumeric. For example: GIFT-[4AN]-[3A]-[5N] => GIFT-J34T-OEC-54354.
  * If you leave the field blank, pattern coupon code(s) will be generated follow this [12AN] pattern randomly. If the coupon link has default pattern, coupon code(s) will be generated automatically when they reload the link.
  * You can enter a pattern optionally. A new coupon will be generated automatically when you reload the link which has that optional pattern coupon. If you enter the coupon code in this field, the coupon link will generate only that entered coupon code. 
* At the **Access Key** column:
  * You can look at the access key dislaying at URL to learn which rule it belongs to.
  * The access key can be changed. Clicking on the reset icon to change the access key randomly.
* At the **Copy** column:
  * Copy and load the link, there will be inform message when the coupon code has been generated successfully. Give this coupon to customer for the checkout process. 
  * Otherwise, store ownners can insert this ``/email/{email}`` variable into the URL, copy and send the link to customers via email. For example: ``http://mageplaza.com/bettercoupon/generatecoupon/generate/mpAccessKey/6aagq3vsndkqe69jbb/email/mageplaza.test@gmail.com``
* At the **Delete** column: Clicking on the bin icon to delete that coupon link.

```
Every time the quick coupon link is rereshed, a new coupon code is generated automatically. If your customers has this link, they will always has different coupon codes to use (or at least until that coupon code validation is expired) so we would highly recommend the quick coupon link should be shared for internal circulation only.
```

* In the **URL** field: Enter the URL which can be accessed and used coupon code(s) by customers.

![bettercoupon5](https://i.imgur.com/ozLUE2y.png)

You can import a CSV file type which contains coupon code in this section. After selecting and importing the file, coupon code will be added in **Manage Coupon Code**.

#### 2.2. Import by Text Area

![bettercoupon6](https://i.imgur.com/x6RBGnp.png)

Similar to [Importing by CSV file](https://docs.mageplaza.com/better-coupon/index.html#ii-import-coupon-code), coupon codes after being imported can be used normally in **Manage Coupon Code** as well.

* Coupons that are entered in the [**Coupons**](https://docs.mageplaza.com/better-coupon/#coupon-link-builder) field or available coupons in the CSV file must be separated by a line break.
* Whereas the current imported coupon list contains some coupon codes identical to the coupon previously created, duplicated codes will not be added anymore and there will be a message telling the store owner how many coupon codes have been coincident.

This is an example of the email informing generated coupon code(s).

### III. API Intergration
Better Coupon extention supports API which means store owners can generate coupon code(s) via Magento 2's API by following this syntax ``domain.com/rest/V1/bettercoupon/rule/id``. For example:

```
http://mageplaza.com/rest/V1/bettercoupon/rule/1 
```

The created coupon link is similar to [The quick coupon link](https://docs.mageplaza.com/better-coupon/#quick-coupon-link-generator), every time the page is refreshed, a new coupon following [12AN] pattern will be generated. Enter the rule ID to decide which rule that coupon code(s) is based on.
