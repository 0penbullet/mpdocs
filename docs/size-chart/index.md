![Size chart attribute](https://i.imgur.com/NlJmEAh.png)


* Attribute Size Chart includes 3 main options:
  * **Inherit from Category/Rule**: When this option is picked, Size Chart which is applied for the product will follow the Size Chart rule of the Category which the product belongs to (according to [Breadcrumbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)) on Frontend)

Example: Product A belongs to two categories which are Women and Jackets.

Case 1: Customer reaches product A by the path: `Home > Women > Tops > Jackets > A`
In this particular case, the size chart for product A will be applied by Rule of category Jackets

Case 2: Customer reaches product A by the path: `Home > Women > A`
In this particular case, the size chart for product B will be applied by Rule of category Women

In case the option `Inherit from Category/Rule` is set for both categories Jackets and Women, all rules in Manage Rule will be filtered to meet the conditions, and the rule with higher priority will be applied on product A

  * **Disable**: The products won't apply the Size Chart Rule
  * **Select a rule created in Manage Rules**: Select any other Size Chart Rule and it is applied even if that rule's status is `Disable`
  
### 4. Size Chart in Categories 

* To set all products in the category by one certain Size Chart Rule, admins can select `Catalog > Categories`, and set the attribute Size Chart similar to when setting Size Chart in `Edit Product`.

![size chart in categories](https://i.imgur.com/CKzyz9B.png)

* If you select **Size Chart = Inherit from Category/Rule**, the selected products (Inherit from Category/Rule in the Edit Product) in the Category will be applied the rule with the satisfied condition and the highest (smallest) Priority.

## Frontend

* Size Chart extension is displayed in the frontend with 3 positions:
