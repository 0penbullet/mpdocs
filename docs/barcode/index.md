With the variable `{{logo_url}}`, you must use the `<img>` tag to display the selected logo image in the above field: `<img src = "{{logo_url}}" alt = "logo">`
With variable `{{attribute_code}}`, you must replace the `attribute_code` with the code of the attribute you want to display. You can go to `Store > Attributes > Product` to get the value in the **Attribute Code** field

<div class = "attribute-code">
        <div>
            Activities: {{activity}}
        </div>
        <div>
